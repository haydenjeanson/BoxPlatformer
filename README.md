# BoxPlatformer
2D Platformer with one screen levels.

In this game, you play as a box with a constant velocity. The main move is to jump. The goal is to reach the end of of the level, indicated by a door.
On some levels there is a tethering mechanic. You can click to fire a ray forward from your block. If the ray collides with another block, you become tethered. Collision and movement controls now affect both blocks, giving both a new challenge and a way to navigate otherwise impassable obstacles.
